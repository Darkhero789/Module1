# Overview

With this project i am testing my game creation skills. I made a basic game where the player jumps around, gathers a few coins, and has to be careful to avoid falling into certain spaces. Once again it is a basic game creation.

using the arrow keys or the wasd keys to move around and jump you will navigate your way through a simple dungeon.

the reason for writing this program was mainly for my own experimenting and testing my skills when it comes to creating a game.

# Development Environment

Using arcade and python i used simple commands to make the program. 

Arcade is a programming extension that works with python to create games in some script writers like Visual Studio Code. Python is a basic programming langauge that was used for the program.

# Future Work
Things i want to fix up or change.
* I'd like to set up the green flag to do more then just show where the finish line is. I'd like for it to be able to change screens or atleast add text to signify that you finished the game.
* I want to change how the lava works. It works by the update function watching the player sprites X&Y coordinates and seeing if it falls into the area the lava fills. Instead i'd like for the lava to be a object and watch to see if the player touches said object. 
* Finally i'd like to lengthen the dungeon and add in more obstacles. i'd like to add in enemies and give the player an attack action that they can use against the enemies they will face.
